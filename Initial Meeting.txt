- build from the information of the last system
	- What going on in the ED?; What is done in the ED?; Which information show we?

- First step 	QR-Code and Data (is established)
- Second step 	After the left of the ED
	- go to house doctor and find the reason because of the ED visit
	- some people don't go to house doctor; just to the ED
	- Frequently visitors
	- Guidlines --> Check up after two weeks after leaving of ED
	- Provide something digitaly and don't become frequently visitors
		- coming back because they don't go to the house doctor

- Maybe:
	- Application to lower the expense to go to doctor?
	- Provide information to patients such as near doctors, etc.?
	- Push-Up notification? (Ask about health?)
	- provide recommendations?
	- careful of advertising?

- Problems:
	- Not everyone has a smartphone --> diversity; provide different ways to get in touch with the house doctor
	- sociological problem --> motiviation of the patient to go to the house doctor
	- try to motivate them while they are leaving --> later they are lazy to make an appointment by the house doctor espicially 
		if they are healthy (better than before)
	- application need to be installed --> maybe a problem?
	- How get we Feedback that they are went to a doctor?
	- House doctor: How does he get the information, how the patient was treated?

==> Application for Patient prefered for the software project
